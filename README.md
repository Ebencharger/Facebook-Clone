# Facebook-Clone
I was just trying to mimick facebook page. 
This work is purely Html, Css, Bootstrap, Saas, and little of Javascript.
Make sure you're connected to the internet, so that the external files used could be displayed properly.
Responsiveness is the major reason of this work. You can toggle on your browser different devices, so as to see how responsive the webpage is.
Definitely there might be some issues noticed, kindly feed me back and I am teachable and ready to learn.
